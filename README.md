## Let's building a web app with Next-App

Practicing to implement an employee API App, where we can
list, create, read, update and delete employees.

### API

Use [restapiexample.com](https://dummy.restapiexample.com)

> [!WARNING]
> API has a rate limit

### Run It

```bash
$ nvm exec 20.9 npm run dev
```

By default, the app is reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### Setup


Installing `nvm` by following this
[guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/).

```bash
$ nvm use
```

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to install the node packages:

```bash
$ npm i
```
